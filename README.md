## Local development setup

This README currently assumes you are on a unix based environment.

### Pre-requisites

You have `git` installed and have cloned this repository.

You have `make` installed:
- On windows:
  - If you have Chocolatey: `choco install make` in an admin terminal (recommended).
  - Direct install ([see here](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm))
  - See also: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows)
- Linux / WSL: `sudo apt install make`
- Mac: `brew install make`

You have [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) installed. ([pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) for Windows).
- See also: common build problems for pyenv https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems

If you're on WSL, you will probably need to do what this answer says: https://stackoverflow.com/a/48304920. It's probably not worth it, just develop on local Windows.

### Setup the project

For the purposes of the below, using Windows Subsystem for Linux does *not*
count as being "on windows".

1. If you have Python 3.11.4 already installed and you are not on windows, you should first uninstall that version. If you are on Windows, skip to step 3.
2. Install the tk headers with `make setup-tk`. Python needs to install after these headers are installed so it can compile with them. It's weird, I don't know.
3. Install vips by following https://www.libvips.org/install.html. Make sure it is added to PATH.
4. Then install python 3.11.4 with `pyenv install 3.11.4`, and set your local python version with `pyenv local 3.11.4`. Confirm with `python --version`.
5. Run `make venv` to create the virtual environment.
6. Run `make setup-dev`. This sets up your python virtual environment and installs the pip requirements in it.
7. Activate the virtual environment in your terminal:
   1. Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   2. Mac / Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

To leave the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.

Run the program with `make start`.

Build the program with `make build`.

### Code Style, Formatting, and Tests

This repository has custom workflows setup in `./github/workflows`. Specifically,
on every push, tests will automatically run to determine if your changes are OK to merge.

Namely, it [lints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) the code to make sure
it follows the defined code style. Additionally, it will automatically run the tests in
`./tests` to ensure you do not introduce any errors into the codebase.

To automatically fix code-style errors, make sure to run `make fmt`.

The lints will also be run in pre-commit hooks and automatically fixed.

See the following example run:
```
>git cam "Test pre-commit"
black....................................................................Failed
- hook id: black
- files were modified by this hook

reformatted src\widgets\image_controller.py

All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted.
```

You would need to re-run the commit in this instance.
