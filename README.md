## Local development setup

This README currently assumes you are on a unix based environment.

1. Run `make setup-dev`. This installs python and sets up your python environment.
2. Run `source venv/bin/activate`. This enables the virtual environment to use on your system.
3. Run `python main.py` to run the python program.

To leave the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.
