# This module contains all of our dirty lil override hacks
#   Usually this means matplotlib overriding of Toolbars,
#   Axes, and such.

# These are HACKS. They WILL break if you update the
#   packages. If we could do these things without doing
#   them this way, we would have, but we can't as far
#   as we know.

# As such, there is a lesser standard of quality to the
#   modules under this package.

# We generally suggest you close your eyes and ears and
#   wonder out this godforsaken space.
